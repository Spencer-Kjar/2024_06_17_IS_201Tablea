                        <h2 class="section-heading">Job Experience</h2>
                        <p>When I was in highschool I worked at Five Guys Burgers and Frys as a Crew Member from June 2018 through Feb. 2019. I Worked in the kitchen making food, worked the register, and cleaned.
                            My first Summer after highschool I worked at BJ Plumbing Supply in American Fork Utah from May 2020 to Sept. 2020. I worked at the register, would answer people's questions, and stock shelves. 
                            While I was studing at USU I worked at MBS Mobile, which was a van that did swallow studies for Seniors to make sure they were swallowing well, as a Medical Assistant from Jan. 2021 to April 2021. I took notes for the swallow tests, set up the food, and cleaned up after.
                            </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Skills</h2>
                        <p>I Love to play music. I can sing, play the trombone, baritone, guitar, and piano.
                            I enjoy researching and learning new stories and facts about history.
                            I love to be with friends and socialize with people, and connecting with them
                            </p>
                        <p>I am also proficent in Excel, coding in VBA, coding in HTML, and using Tableau. 
                            I am also experienced in using the finance software Chrome River.

                        <p>Something that I find incredibly rewarding is working and becoming friends with those who have
